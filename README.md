# caps

in this lab we used the events in the node.js ,we setup a pool of event and handler functions, our CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors  will ship products using the  delivery service and when the  drivers deliver them, the  vendor will be notified that their customers received what they purchased.

in the vendor.js we  alert the system when we have a package to be picked up and we will be notfied when the package has been recevied 
in driver, we will  be notified when there is a package to be delivered, and alert the system when I have picked up a package and it is in transit.

the code has been refactored using socket io insted of using the events to get the same result we have last lab .
